    <h3>Types of Readings</h3>
    <p>Tarot has several types of readings and different readings can give you different information. Currently, Azure Tarot supports the single card reading and the three card reading. In the future it will also include the celtic cross, but don't worry about that yet since it's a much more advanced type of reading.</p>
    <br/><br/>
    <p>The single card reading is great for a quick and easy reading for that day. This reading connects to your present moment in some way. For example, if you drew the Tower card it might indicate you're on the course towards some kind of calamity. If you drew the Fool, it might be telling you to start a new project or move ahead with something.</p>
    <br/><br/>
    <p>The three card reading very simply enough involves three cards: one for the past, one for the present, and one for the future. I should probably mention that tarot isn't exactly fortune telling and it won't tell you whether something will happen, the card for the future represents a possibility or a warning.</p>
