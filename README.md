## Features

Azure Tarot teaches people how to do readings in tarot and what each card means.

### Cards

The hand crafted cards in Azure Tarot give life to readings. We've given every card a unique animation to make it memorable and help it stand apart from its cardboard cousins.

No matter where a student has gone on the website, every card can be clicked to bring up additional information like its background, keywords, an useful questions to ask during a reading.

## Readings

Azure Tarot currently supports two different types of readings: the single card reading and the three card reading. Students can look at past readings anytime and add helpful notes to reflect on later.

## Lessons

Tarot is a form of communication. It wants its students to make personal connections with the cards in the deck. Because of that, the lessons in Azure Tarot ask students to reflect on the cards they find and then write their own descriptions for the cards.
